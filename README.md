# Music_Visualizer
Homemade project using Python &amp; Arduino. 

It consists  mainly of audio processing through Fast Fourier Transform in order to display a variety of audio frequencies across LED strips.

## Main libraries used.:

  [Arduino] FastLed http://fastled.io 
  
  [Python] FFT https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/routines.fft.html
  
  [Python] Souddevice https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.13/
  

## In future builds.:

  [Arduino] Improvements in colour management through proper functions.
  
  [Python] Improvements in normalization method applied in sound data.
